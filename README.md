## Introduction
Red Teaming is a simulated cyberattack conducted with permission to test an organizationâ€™s defenses.  
The goal is to identify weaknesses before real attackers exploit them.

---

## Phases of a Red Team Operation

### 1. Planning & Scoping
- Define objectives, scope, and rules of engagement.
- Get **written permission** before starting.
- Identify **in-scope** and **out-of-scope** systems.

### 2. Reconnaissance (Recon)
- **Passive Recon**: Collect information without touching target systems.  
  *Examples:* Search engines, social media, WHOIS.
- **Active Recon**: Direct interaction with systems.  
  *Examples:* Ping sweeps, Nmap scans.

### 3. Initial Access
- Phishing campaigns.
- Exploiting known vulnerabilities.
- Brute-force or default credentials.

### 4. Privilege Escalation
- Exploit weak configurations.
- Use stolen credentials.
- Exploit local system vulnerabilities.

### 5. Lateral Movement
- Expand access between systems.
- Tools: PsExec, RDP, SMB exploits.

### 6. Persistence
- Maintain long-term access.
- Methods: Hidden admin accounts, backdoors.

### 7. Exfiltration & Impact
- Simulate stealing sensitive data.
- Avoid real damage unless approved.

### 8. Reporting
A professional report should include:
- Vulnerabilities found.
- How they were exploited.
- Recommendations for mitigation.

## Common Tools
- **Metasploit** â€“ Exploitation framework.
- **Nmap** â€“ Network scanning.
- **Burp Suite** â€“ Web application testing.
- **Cobalt Strike** â€“ Command & control framework.

---

## Ethics & Legal Considerations
- **Never** perform red teaming without explicit permission.
- Follow agreed scope and rules strictly.
- Keep all findings confidential.

## Quick Reference
- **Plan & Scope** â†’ Rules + permission.
- **Recon** â†’ Passive (Google, WHOIS), Active (Nmap).
- **Initial Access** â†’ Phishing, exploits, weak creds.
- **Privilege Escalation** â†’ Misconfigurations, exploits, stolen creds.
- **Lateral Movement** â†’ Spread through network.
- **Persistence** â†’ Hidden accounts, backdoors.
- **Exfiltration** â†’ Simulated data theft.
- **Report** â†’ Findings + fixes.
- **Tools** â†’ Nmap, Metasploit, Cobalt Strike, Burp Suite.
- **Rule** â†’ Always legal & ethical.
